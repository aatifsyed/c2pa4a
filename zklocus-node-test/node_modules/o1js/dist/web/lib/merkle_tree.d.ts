 * A [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) is a binary tree in which every leaf is the cryptography hash of a piece of data,

 * A Merkle Tree allows developers to easily and securely verify the integrity of large amounts of data.
 *
 * Take a look at our [documentation](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/en/zkapps) on how to use Merkle Trees in combination with zkApps and zero knowledge programming!
 *
 * Levels are indexed from leaves (level 0) to root (level N - 1).
