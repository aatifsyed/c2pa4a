/**
 * Interface for storing and retrieving values, for caching.
 * `read()` and `write()` can just throw errors on failure.
 *
 * The data that will be passed to the cache for writing is exhaustively described by the {@link CacheHeader} type.
 * It represents one of the following:
 * - The SRS. This is a deterministic lists of curve points (one per curve) that needs to be generated just once,
 *   to be used for polynomial commitments.
 * - Lagrange basis commitments. Similar to the SRS, this will be created once for every power-of-2 circuit size.
 * - Prover and verifier keys for every compiled circuit.
 *
 * Per smart contract or ZkProgram, several different keys are created:
 * - a step prover key (`step-pk`) and verification key (`step-vk`) _for every method_.
 * - a wrap prover key (`wrap-pk`) and verification key (`wrap-vk`) for the entire contract.
